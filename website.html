                      As an Intern QA Engineer at Operto Guest Technologies, I was part of the Product team and reported to the Quality Assurance Manager.
                      During my internship, I had the opportunity to have a direct impact on Operto's business and work in the IoT domain.
                      My responsibilities included testing internal and external products for bugs and other flaws, verifying the proper
                      implementation of features, maintaining a reporting system, providing written and verbal reports, and performing regression tests.
                      I also helped run build verification checklists against a range of IoT devices, desktop browsers, and mobile platforms.
                      Operto's culture is vibrant and fun, and I enjoyed participating in regular team get-togethers and celebrations.

                      Performed manual testing, building automated tests and data validation via 
                      unit tests, integration tests and end-to-end UI automation acceptance tests. 
                      The total automated test run time was reduced by 50% from 6 to 3 hours. 
                      Worked with Jenkins and SQL databases to create testing datasets. Created 
                      a live test failure reporter to help developers view and analyze test builds 
                      progress before completion.
